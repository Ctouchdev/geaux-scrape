I have been blessed beyond my wildest dreams and it breaks my heart to see people and other animals suffer no matter where they maybe in this world full of problems. Hate and Ignorance are the rails for agony.

1482731579462017027 2022-01-16 09:08:51 -0500 <joe_lagrone> Mark Elias, the plans to cheat at ballot box and to wail fraud were planned well in advance of the election. Too well coordinated to have been on the spot reactions.

1478177051970519040 2022-01-03 19:30:47 -0500 <joe_lagrone> @StevenBeschloss I share your frustrations. Mark Meadows was referred to DOJ 20 days ago and no word. Have not heard of any Target Letters. Plenty of evidence on sound re GA election. I worry that he's showing defference to Trump  because he's a former President.
1477667780333817860 2022-01-02 09:47:07 -0500 <joe_lagrone> @hugolowell I saw Trump, while riot occuring, in a tent with Mark Meadows, Don Jr and others. He may have retreated to WH but footage will show him, et al in a tent.
