Vanguard and BlackRock have Blackstone in various mutual funds, ETFs, and client accounts, so the clients own the shares but it's hidden to the world.  Eg if I buy IBM, it looks like Fidelity, my broker, owns it.

1508566309801500684 2022-03-28 17:06:50 -0500 <gauravsabnis> He is not disabled. He doesn't seem mentally ill. He is never dangerous. Never heard him raise his voice. He still talks like the engineer he is. Like that's one thing he's still holding on to. His engineering, his IBM business cards, smart conversations.
1508563615833591808 2022-03-28 16:56:08 -0500 <gauravsabnis> He calls me big blue after I told him I'd spent time at IBM and also at Penn State, which is also called big blue. He never says my name. I don't think he remembers it though he takes my business card every time and stores it in a big stack of cards. I can see my older cards.
1508561768498532359 2022-03-28 16:48:47 -0500 <gauravsabnis> I've talked to him several times whenever I pass. Every conversation leaves me thinking, there but for some good fortune goes I.  He was devastated by a failed marriage. Hit the bottle hard. IBM, he lovingly said, gave him "a very long rope". He just had a total breakdown.
1508561298472284162 2022-03-28 16:46:55 -0500 <gauravsabnis> If you think like a human being instead of a cable news panelist, and really, just talk to a few of them, you'll see how complicated the story is.
