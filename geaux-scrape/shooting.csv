1488723179178795009 2022-02-01 21:57:19 -0500 <jllanclos> Shooting in this Suns game is ridiculous.
1487525907040546816 2022-01-29 14:39:47 -0500 <DjMatchiz> Gronk most likely shooting out too
1481799296848744449 2022-01-13 19:24:17 -0500 <_Meaux_> People who don't understand basketball gone say the NBA rigged with GS losing. Here's a couple notes  - Steph hasn't been shooting well since a couple games before he broke the record  - Klay back but so is Wiggins (who in my opinion doesn't complement floor spacing with those 2
1476349544724148236 2021-12-29 18:28:55 -0500 <AllthingsLSU> Why the hell are we only shooting 3’s

1467371982522101767 2021-12-04 23:55:17 -0500 <SuperMcDadXXL> @get_vaxxedd @Mr_Riot @claes69 @davidfrum I've personally prevented 2 potential shooting casualties in my adult life simply by being legally armed in 2 diff. situations. 2 ppl went home alive bec I was a law abiding + trained fellow citizen &amp; 2 ppl served time for being morons. My life is proof we're not all evil.
1467369262759268358 2021-12-04 23:44:29 -0500 <SuperMcDadXXL> @claes69 @get_vaxxedd @davidfrum Research shows that Good Guys with guns stop Bad Guys with guns an overwhelming majority of cases. And deter bad guys from shooting in areas Good Guys are. They don't like being shot back at...bad for crook business...
1467364405130186754 2021-12-04 23:25:11 -0500 <SuperMcDadXXL> @Mr_Riot @claes69 @get_vaxxedd @davidfrum Nope. Go look @ high casualty shooting locations. They're overwhelmingly in Gun Free areas. Criminals aren't in the biz of committing crimes n places they'll get shot back at. They think/know n their minds that they'll get away to do it again.  Good ppl w guns stop bad ppl w guns
