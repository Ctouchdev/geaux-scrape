How her day started, what she did, her worries about class later. When she was going to nap. This wasnt small talk. This was large talk for the Rouses check out.

1314348599212351488 2020-10-08 18:35:00 -0500 <amlikethewind> Universal pre-storm truth: The Bread aisle is always the first to go. @ Rouses Markets  https://t.co/gK1jt3ESSu
1303020804335169544 2020-09-07 12:22:23 -0500 <scottkdurbin> @slittwin Itâ€™s a pork and rice mixture - often in a casing. With the kolache, the breading is the casing. Sidebar: Rouses (a regional grocery chain) makes this amazing bacon wrapped, boudin-stuffed pork tenderloin but itâ€™s too high in sodium for me. Delicious- yes ... healthy? Debatable;)
