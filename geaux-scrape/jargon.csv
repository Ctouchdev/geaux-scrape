They are not meant to be used in everyday life.

Hint: don’t use the word “vectors” before others have agreed to play and the game is in progress. The actuality is easy, but the jargon can scare.

1510784311619817472 2022-04-03 20:00:23 -0500 <copy_tips> Not all jargon is bad. Sometimes, it's actually domain language: the specialised words and phrases used by a certain group. Use it properly and you can build rapport.

Everything from a basic definition to very technical terms/concepts. Almost every question I was asked was linked to one of those terms.

Saying I used the static representation of an approximate dynamic factor model to identify structural shocks means nothing to you, but it speaks to a flexible set of tools I get to summarize in a sentence for an abstract.

Jargon (the use of technical concepts) is useful when talking to people who know it, but outside of that circle it acts as a barrier to understanding. Because of that, it can also be used to give the air without the substance of sophistication.

1510629997920153600 2022-04-03 09:47:12 -0500 <nom_de_non> @janbeetlle @stillgray Jargon is the appeal. It’s pokeman cards for your own identity. This is day1 at hogwarts but you get to be your own sorting hat. This nonsense started with astrology and horoscopes. “I am a Libra and that means a I’m smart and special but I’m a handful - hahah” - this is that.

"Tr@ns" operates as a cult, proselytizing to new members. This cult is more poisonous than the Jonestown koolaid. To take down cults we can't participate in cult jargon.

Either: 1) You look like you don't know what you're talking about if you can't explain it in simple English. 2) You come off as belittling or deceiving your audience.

1510588392995762177 2022-04-03 07:01:52 -0500 <jktweets> @LucieWestenra @jk_rowling @TrustFundOzu I have no idea what it’s saying. Jargon obscures meaning.
1510588303212490764 2022-04-03 07:01:31 -0500 <infoonitydotcom> @JustSaratt @hakluke That's actually a great point. I get the same way when people use specialized terms and acronyms in other fields. Like someone was trying to tell me an insurance industry thing with jargon and my first thought was like, "Ok but in English though." xD So I totally get it.
1510588295624867845 2022-04-03 07:01:29 -0500 <PIIARCHIVED> @carendible ajak aku kak ca. jaemren lagi mode jargon yamaha  'semakin di depan'
1510587902882811905 2022-04-03 06:59:56 -0500 <Sat_Pinayungan> @Cyberkiller717 JARGON nya di ganti aja jadi "PARTAINYA WONG LICIK" Kayaknya lebih cocok sama kondisi sekarang ini

1510586362164133891 2022-04-03 06:53:48 -0500 <JargonDragoon> @Celia_valinor92 Te lo mereces Celia, me alegro mucho por ti 😊
1510586276185001984 2022-04-03 06:53:28 -0500 <Cornegidouill3> @magb6_9 @travik69 Oui, les vrais temps de passage. Je fonctionne toujours comme ça, je pars tranquille avec accélération progressive (négative split dans le jargon)  Sauf que la, ça n’a pas marché comme d’habitude, 😂 donc on passe en mode gestion pour finir.
1510584938638483461 2022-04-03 06:48:09 -0500 <AzfarinazAmran> Mat Jargon ni aku tak tahu la dia punya level kipas tara mana. Sembang kari dia lagi pekat dari kari.   Nasib baik bulan posa.  Kalau tak jenuh aku carut. 😎  https://t.co/80Svgeel17
1510584771562270721 2022-04-03 06:47:29 -0500 <SwagaGunner> the steps to ripping fl studio sound like total jargon, luckily i get other people to make my funny hello rips!
1510584593732476928 2022-04-03 06:46:47 -0500 <jargon053112> 働いてるとさ、もんすごい高圧的で闇が深い人いる。 なんでいきなりそんな瞳孔が開いてんの？って笑いそうになる。  抑圧されてんだろうな。寂しい生活してんだろうな。
1510584375775223814 2022-04-03 06:45:55 -0500 <mauro_bernabei> @instanthero @idreesali114 @sentdefender In military jargon it means they are weapons that do not accept NATO standard ammunition. In practice it means that they are weapons and ammunition compatible with the former Soviet ones used by the Ukrainian army
1510584073076756483 2022-04-03 06:44:42 -0500 <faisal_bucho> @HabisNontonFilm Jeng Kellin sih yang dapet banget karakter nya. Kalo Rina nose jujur sy kurang sreg  Fitrop hafal jargon nya " sepenti yeus old cimahi" Extravaganza udh lupa, tapi dulu tontonan wajib sih.
1510583816590614534 2022-04-03 06:43:41 -0500 <TheBingle> The problem with the medical profession is really not respecting what patients are trying to say without using medical jargon. Diagnosis can be patient's biggest problem when the professionals get it wrong!
1510583579410980869 2022-04-03 06:42:45 -0500 <abuyamani9> @geloraco Gotong royong itu jargon KGB 😁
1510583275215101953 2022-04-03 06:41:32 -0500 <Mnoorist> @GhostBRAJ @NeoSats @Mano10Napel No it doesn't. Stop using stupid jargon to justify a horrid  technology because u think it will make u rich.   Most of btc is still produced by using coal, and fossil fuel.  Electricity is needed to essential human function, not so crap tech that does 4 transactions/sec
1510582738289537028 2022-04-03 06:39:24 -0500 <PapaDuvalier> @paul5mith1001 in simple terms it is known as a scam, The City thrives on this, or in real technical jargon rehypoticated
1510581039915499522 2022-04-03 06:32:39 -0500 <muhsinlabib> Hanya dalam hitungan jam, setelah sebelumnya PM Imran Khan mendapatkan mosi tidak percaya, Majelis Nasional Pakistan dibubarkan. Karena kebijakan PM Imran yang pro Rusia, pemerintah AS mendanai oposisi dan militer untuk mendongkel PM Imran. Demokrasi hanya jargon palsu USA si ASU
1510580918188187649 2022-04-03 06:32:10 -0500 <sevgi_alis_> @OUstungelen Her dönem farklı bir jargon, dil vb kullanarak aynı tarihi anlatır.
1510579091241680897 2022-04-03 06:24:55 -0500 <muronda_james> @KMutisi But shuwa they confuse people even jargon. Imwe confusion futi pakuti ku airport vachirikuda maPCR from people leaving Zimbabwe vachienda kunyika dzisirikuda negative PCR. Does the SI address this at all?
1510578415484772359 2022-04-03 06:22:14 -0500 <AndrewAPrice> I'm paid to take complicated problems and make them simple.  When it comes to communication, smart people can take complicated topics and explain them simply.  Unnecessary verbosity or inside jargon (especially when talking with outsiders) makes you a clown.
1510578024936194049 2022-04-03 06:20:40 -0500 <datempd> Don’t bother me with jargon right now, alright?
1510577849186533383 2022-04-03 06:19:59 -0500 <ValKphotos> @ScorchMusic @karacole__ Houla tu m'as perdue, je cause pas jargon technique pardon 😬
